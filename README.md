# analysis-of-material-composites

The aim of the project is to analyse the properties of different composites using machine learning. The analysis is done by using inputs in terms of parameters representing different fibres or composites that define our initial composite structure. While tackling the two problems, it would be crucial to also take into account sources of errors arising from computational homogenisation while ensuring efficiency and minimal computational time.
